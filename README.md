# A-B-Testing-to-optimize-Netflix-Browsing-Time

- Goal of the experiment was to find the levels of significant factors that minimize the average browsing time of Netflix simulated data
- Identified the significant main effects and performed the method of steepest descent to find the vicinity of the optimum
- Found the optimal values of the factor levels for the second-order model by studying the Central Composite Design and confirmed the resultsusing the probability of agreement
